# evolutionary process ideas :
#
# 1 - 
# mutation = application of transfo from (partition +) alter, morph
# genotype = phenotype = image(s)
# fitness = user-defined based on phenotype
#
# 2 -
# mutation = adding / subtracting / modifying from transfo sequence
# genotype = transfo sequence
# phenotype = image(s) resulting from cascading transfos in sequence
# fitness = user-defined based on phenotype
